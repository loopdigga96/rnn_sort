# rnn_sort

Implementation of Seq2Seq model based on RNN for sorting sequences of natural numbers from 0 to 999

### Plan 

- Implement simple dense layer with backprop
- Figure out with BPTT
- Implement rnn cell in numpy
- Implement dataset generation in numpy(train, validation)
- Implement one hot encoding
- Gradient checking
- Implemnt metrics measurement
